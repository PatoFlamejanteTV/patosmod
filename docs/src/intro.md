# Whats 'PatosMod'?

PatosMod is a sandbox-like engine/base that you can interact with multiple languages at the same project, using a built-in powerful API and many other resources. PatosMod is also (slighlty) based on [Garrys Mod](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod).

## What languages i can use?

Currently:

- [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) [Recommended, mainly used/configured]
- [Visual Basic .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/) [Recommended, WIP]
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) [WIP]
